Fire risk is also heightened around major and remote towns, including Alice Springs and Tennant Creek.\n\nBetween December and January, the Fire Danger Period remains in effect across the Barkly region and parts of the Alice Springs Fire Management Zone, including the Alice Springs Fire Protection Zone, Simpson East and West and Tanami North and South.\n\nCentral Australian residents should remain proactive by managing firebreaks, clearing around their properties and going through their bushfire survival plans with their households to ensure everyone knows what to do in an emergency. \n\nIn the Top End, bushfire risk is expected to continue to decrease with the onset of the wet season, presenting an opportunity for fire mitigation activities from crews and volunteers. \n\nTo read the seasonal outlook visit: https://www.afac.com.au/seasonal-outlook. \n\nFor fire ban information, bushfire warnings, and advice, visit Secure NT  https://securent.nt.gov.au/.\nFor more information follow https://www.facebook.com/BushfiresNT",
